#LIP - Package Management for LIME Pro

LIP is a package management tool for LIME Pro. A package can currently contain declarations for fields and tables, VBA modules, localizations, LIME Bootstrap Apps and SQL-procedures. LIP downloads and installs packages from Package Stores. A Package Store is any valid source which serves correct JSON-files and package.zip files. Currently the LIME Bootstrap AppStore is the only available Package Store.

LIP is inspired from Pythons PIP and Nodes NPM but adapted for LIME Pro.

##Using LIP
The current implementation is written in VBA and is used in the immediate window in LIME Pro's VBA-editor.

###Get started
Before you can start installing packages, you need to install LIP to your LIME Pro database. Download the zip-file, which includes all necessary files to get started, and follow these steps:

1. Add the SQL-procedures to your database
2. Run `EXEC lsp_refreshldc` on your database
3. Import the `vba/lip.bas`-file to your VBA. Compile and save.

The first time you install a package, some necessary VBA-modules will automatically be installed.

###Install a package 
To install a package simply run

`lip.Install "ExamplePackage"`

###Install all dependencies for a LIME Pro solution
All installed packages are kept tracked of inside the `package.json`-file in the ActionPad folder. If you transfer this file to a new LIME Pro database you can use this file to conduct a brand new install. Just type

`lip.Install`

###Update a package
If a package already exist and should be updated or reinstalled you must explicitly use the update command 

`lip.Update "ExamplePackage"`

###Remove a package
__Not yet implemented!__
Should remove a specified package

`lip.Remove "ExamplePackage"`

###Freeze a solution to a package
__Not yet implemented!__
Compare to `pip freeze > requirement.txt`. Creates a package from a LIME Pro solution.

`lip.Freeze`

##Behind the scene



### A Package
A package is a ZIP-file containing all required resources to install a package

### A Package Store
A Package Store could either be file based or web based. A store has a fixed URL (example "http://limebootstrap.lundalogik.se/api/apps"). The URL has subdirectories for each app (example "./checklist"). If the source is a file-based a `/package.json` should automatically be append. This URL should return a JSON as:

```JSON

    "name": "[NAME OF PACKAGE]",
    "author":"[AUTHORS NAME]",

The installer should first see if a package is locally installed or not. If the package is installed local

### Versioning
####Package versioning
Packages should adhere to semantic versioning, example `1.0.0` or `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. Please read [this](http://semver.org). 

Simplified:
`MAJOR`: Breaks backwards compatibility
`MINOR`: Adds new features but backward compatible
`PATCH`: Bugfixes

Minor and Patchs should always be upgrade to automatically if a dependency require it.

Major versions can only be upgraded to if explicit Upgrade command is used

####Dependency versioning
Stateing dependency verisons should adhere to [NPMs versioning](https://github.com/npm/node-semver)

A `version range` is a set of `comparators` which specify versions
that satisfy the range.

A `comparator` is composed of an `operator` and a `version`.  The set
of primitive `operators` is:

* `<` Less than
* `<=` Less than or equal to
* `>` Greater than
* `>=` Greater than or equal to
* `=` Equal.  If no operator is specified, then equality is assumed,
  so this operator is optional, but MAY be included.

For example, the comparator `>=1.2.7` would match the versions
`1.2.7`, `1.2.8`, `2.5.3`, and `1.3.9`, but not the versions `1.2.6`
or `1.1.0`.
